Welcome to this little spot where I share a bit about myself and a few of the things that I enjoy outside of work.

## About Me

When I'm not deep in the pages of a horror novel 📖 or out logging miles on a long run 🏃‍♀️, you'll likely find me with knitting needles in hand 🧶, creating cozy projects for me and my family. Speaking of cozy, my three furry companions: our two black cats Mac and Cheese, and everybody's favorite dog Daisy, definitely add a lot of warmth to my days.

You can see some of my knitting projects on [Ravelry]({{ site.socials.ravelry.url }}).

Professionally, I've lived a lot of lives. I've tested soil for new roads and bridges in Kentucky, I built several of schools and houses in upstate New York, and for the last (nearly) two decades I've been building software and software teams.

I've worked for companies where I was the fifth employee and the 150,000th. Currently I work remotely in the mid-Atlantic region as a Senior Engineering Manager for [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/). You can find some of my thoughts on management over at my blog, [The Effortless Manager](https://theeffortlessmanager.com).

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to connect with me on the platforms on the side.
