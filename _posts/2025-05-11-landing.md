Welcome to this little spot where I share a bit about myself and a few of the things that bring me joy outside of work.

## About Me

When I'm not immersed in the thrilling pages of a horror novel 📖 or out logging miles on a long run 🏃‍♀️, you'll likely find me with knitting needles in hand 🧶, creating cozy projects. Speaking of cozy, my three furry companions, Mac and Cheese (our two black cats), and Daisy (the world's best mixed-breed dog), definitely add a lot of warmth to my days.

You can see some of my knitting projects on my [Ravelry profile](https://www.ravelry.com/people/your_ravelry_username).

Professionally, I work in the field of management. You can find my thoughts and insights on that over at my blog, [The Effortless Manager](https://theeffortlessmanager.com).

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to connect with me on the platforms below.
