Welcome to this little spot where I share a bit about myself and a few of the things that I enjoy outside of work.

## About Me

When I'm not immersed in the pages of a horror novel 📖 or out logging miles on a long run 🏃‍♀️, you'll likely find me with knitting needles in hand 🧶, creating cozy projects. Speaking of cozy, my three furry companions: our two black cats Mac and Cheese, and everybody's favorite dog Daisy, definitely add a lot of warmth to my days.

You can see some of my knitting projects on my [Ravelry profile]({{ site.socials.ravelry.url }}).

Professionally, I've lived a lot of lives. I've tested soil for new roads and bridges in Kentucky, I built several of schools and houses in upstate New York, and for the last (nearly) two decades I've been in software. I've worked for companies where I was the fifth employee and the 150,000th. I work remotely in the mid-Atlantic region as a software engineering manager for Zendesk. You can find some of my thoughts on management over at my blog, [The Effortless Manager](https://theeffortlessmanager.com).
